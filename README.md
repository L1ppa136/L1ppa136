Currently working as a System Analyst for Innoveo, configuring applications using company's own low-code platform.

Familiar with the following technologies:
- Javascript (NodeJS, ExpressJS, React)
- NoSQL (Mongoose / MongoDB)
- C# (Identity, Entity Framework, LINQ, WebAPI, etc.)
- SQL (MySQL, PostgreSQL)

I am more than excited to learn, improve and develop in both hard and soft skills in the next upcoming years and beyond.
