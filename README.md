Studying as a Fullstack Developer since 2023 February. Before switching careers, I have gained more than 10 years of experience in automotive Quality Engineering along with 4 years as team / group leader.

During my journey to become a junior I have worked with and studied the following technologies:
- Javascript (NodeJS, ExpressJS, React)
- Mongoose / MongoDB
- C#

I am more than excited to learn, improve and develop in both hard and soft skills in the next upcoming years and beyond.
